## Description 
 This was the twentieth homework assignment for the full stack web development program at UC Irvine, in which the goal was to redo our portfolio pages using React. The criteria for the portoflio included have a navbar and footer which should appear on all pages, use the React Router component to route between pages, and have a single project component which can be used to map out all entered portfolio projects.

## Technologies 
* This application is written using the React.js javascript framework as well as JSX.
* It used the Router component in React.
* It uses CSS/Bootstrap for styling.
* It requires node.js to run it.

## Usage 
If using from the Github pages deployed application, just go to the deployed application's [link](https://maxx105.github.io/react_portfolio/). There are four pages to this portfolio: a home page, an about page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. These are accessible via the navbar ("Maxx Sanner" takes you to the home page). The portfolio page provides screenshots and links to both the deployed application and github repo page for some of my projects. If running off a local server, first do an npm install then run the server by running the "npm start" command in a gitbash terminal. This will initialize the React app.
